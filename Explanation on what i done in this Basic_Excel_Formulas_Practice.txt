In this i worked on some basic excel formulas 

=sum(Range) here we need to specify range(i calculated this total sum of salaries with this)

=average(rang) here also we need to specify some range(i calculated average of age from the data)

=max(range) we will get the max value from the given range

=min(range) we will get minimum value from the given range

And later i add one column called Level_by_salary and as well as Level_by_Experiace

For that column i just used if condition as if(E2>50000,"Senior","Junior")

This is like if else block in programming and this e2 refers salary

if salary>50000 then it will print Senior 
if salary<50000 then it will print Junior

and later i just added one more column for this as Level_by_Experiance
with same if condition but now i used experience instead of salary this time

and later i count the no of senior and as well as juniors using this

countif(range,"Senior") #This will return me this count of the seniors in this specified range


And later i just added filter to the columns using simple shortcut ctrl+shift+L then filter will be applied
or else we can manually apply them which we have the function in data ribbon in this sort and filter section

and i practiced some filtering as well selecting only salary less than 40000 and as well as at specified department
